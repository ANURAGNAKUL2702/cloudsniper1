Based on the user's request, create a detailed execution plan.

Format your response as valid JSON with this structure:
{
    "task_analysis": "Brief analysis of what the user wants to accomplish",
    "plan": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "action": "Action name",
            "description": "Detailed description of this step",
            "estimated_time": "Time estimate (e.g., '5 minutes', '2 hours')"
        }
    ],
    "requirements": ["Any prerequisites", "Dependencies", "Tools needed"],
    "success_criteria": ["How to know the task is complete", "Expected outcomes"]
}

Important:
- Ensure the JSON is valid and well-formatted
- Make plans specific and actionable
- Consider the user's context and skill level
- Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Include realistic time estimates
- List all necessary requirements upfront
- Define clear success criteria
